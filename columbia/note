Strained at 1.27 degrees; vF=2680, w0=77meV, w1 = 110meV
omitting small angle Pauli rotation 
strain 0.2%, director 0 degrees,
strained BM bandwidth +/- 50 meV,
gap to remote band ~ 50meV
dielectric constant 15, e^2/epsilon Lm ~ 9meV

Data organization --- 

for every flux ratio, density----
xx lowest energy always 1_random or 1_flavor 
xx also keeep other files that have converged but named with different numbers 
xx convergence criterion is norm difference < 0.001
xx also keeps track of metastable states that have also stablized
