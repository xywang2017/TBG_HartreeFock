Unstrained at magic angle from condition w1/vfktheta = 0.586
omitting small angle Pauli rotation 
BM bandwidth +/- 1 meV
strong coupling analysis, dielectric constant 10

Data organization --- 

for every flux ratio, density----
xx lowest energy always 1_random or 1_flavor 
xx also keeep other files that have converged but named with different numbers 
xx convergence criterion is norm difference < 0.001
xx also keeps track of metastable states that have also stablized
